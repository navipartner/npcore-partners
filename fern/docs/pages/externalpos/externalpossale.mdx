title: "Introduction to External POS Sale API"

The External POS Sale API allows you to insert sales performed in another POS system and eventually get it converted to a POS Entry.
You can insert the sale and query for the sale again.

<Warning>This API is still under development and may change slightly in the future.</Warning>

title: "Introduction to Sales Documents API"

---

The Sales Documents API is designed to synchronize sales orders and sales return orders between NP Retail and third-party systems such as online stores, marketplaces, or external order platforms.
With this API, external systems can send new orders directly into NP Retail in real time. Each order includes details like items, quantities, prices, customer info, and delivery addresses. The API ensures that all necessary data is captured accurately and processed automatically.
This integration helps keep both systems aligned, reduces manual work, and ensures that order fulfillment in NP Retail happens smoothly and without delay.

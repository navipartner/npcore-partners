## Table of HTTP Error Codes
The following HTTP status error codes are commonly used in the NaviPartner REST API:

|------|------------------------------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request: The request could not be understood by the server. |
| 401  | Unauthorized: Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. |
| 403  | Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. |
| 404  | Not Found: The requested resource could not be found. |
| 405  | Method Not Allowed: The request method is not supported for the requested resource. |
| 408  | Request Timeout: The server timed out waiting for the request. |

We indicate the type of API error that occured in two ways:
- HTTP status codes.
- Unique Error Codes. If a situation occurs that you are expected to be able to react to with more precision than HTTP status codes would allow, we will return a unique error code in the response body as well.

## Example Error Body

Our error responses always have the following JSON structure:
```json
{
  "code": "generic_error",
  "message": "Http method OPTIONS is not supported."
}
```

## HTTP Error Status Codes
The following HTTP status error codes are used in our API:

| Status Code | Description                              |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request: The request could not be understood by the server. |
| 401  | Unauthorized: Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. |
| 403  | Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. |
| 404  | Not Found: The requested resource could not be found. |
| 405  | Method Not Allowed: The request method is not supported for the requested resource. |
| 408  | Request Timeout: The server timed out waiting for the request. |
| 409  | Conflict: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. |
| 410  | Gone: The resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. |
| 413  | Payload Too Large: The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process. |
| 415  | Unsupported Media Type: The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. |
| 416  | Range Not Satisfiable: The server cannot provide the requested range of data. |
| 422  | Unprocessable Entity: The server understands the request, but could not succeed in processing it. |
| 429  | Too Many Requests: Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
| 500  | Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. |
| 501  | Not Implemented: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. |
| 502  | Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server. |
| 503  | Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance. |
| 504  | Gateway Timeout: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server. |
| 505  | HTTP Version Not Supported: The server does not support the HTTP protocol version that was used in the request. |

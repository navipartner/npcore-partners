Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time event notifications from our system. Instead of polling for updates, you can configure a URL endpoint where we will send event payloads as POST requests.

You can explore available webhooks in this portal.

## Quick Start

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Create a webhook subscription">
    Subscribe to an event you chose:
    <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /:tenant/:environment/:company/webhook" example="WebhookSubscriptionRequestExample" />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Webhook notifications">
    When a webhooks is triggered, you'll receive a POST request:
    ```json
    {
      "value": [
        {
          "appId": "992c2309-cca4-43cb-9e41-911f482ec088",
          "clientState": "HVA0Y6B84KBNISG45W6CA4TNE38CHSBASD",

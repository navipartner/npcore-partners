description: Overview of essential system service endpoints.
---

Our API provides several essential endpoints designed to facilitate key system operations. 
These endpoints serve critical functions for interacting with our Business Central backend, ensuring smooth communication and reliable access to foundational resources. 
Currently, we offer the following system services:

### Companies Endpoint

The [companies](/api-reference/system-services/companies/get-companies) endpoint returns a list of companies available in your Business Central environment. 
As Business Central operates on a multi-company model, this list is essential for all subsequent API calls, allowing clients to specify the company context 
in which an operation should be performed.


### Hello World Endpoint

The [helloworld](/api-reference/system-services/helloworld/get-hello-world) endpoint serves as a diagnostic tool to verify that communication between the API client, middleware, and backend is functioning correctly. 
This endpoint is data-agnostic and provides a simple response confirming that the entire API pipeline is operational.

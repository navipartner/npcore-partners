## Companies in Business Central
Companies in Business Central are data containers that keep business data isolated within the same database. Each company has its own set of data tables.

## API Usage
All API calls must specify the company except for the Companies endpoint.

## Companies Endpoint
Get a list of available companies:

```http

```
<Warning>This endpoint is an exception in terms of routing, as it does not use the global path segment named `company`.</Warning>

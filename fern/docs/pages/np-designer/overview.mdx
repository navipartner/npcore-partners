## General
This set of endpoints is used by NP Designer to build content intended to be shipped to the customer. A manifest contains all assets bundled and is made accessible to the rendering tool as a batch.

## WebHooks
The following webhooks can be subscribed to; each is emitted when the described event occurs:

- **designer_manifest_created** — Emitted when a new manifest is created.
- **designer_manifest_content_added** — Emitted when one or more assets are added to an existing manifest.
- **designer_manifest_content_removed** — Emitted when one or more assets are removed from a manifest.
- **designer_manifest_content_changed** — Emitted when multiple assets are added to or removed from a manifest in a single batch. This consolidated event reduces webhook spam.
- **designer_manifest_deleted** — Emitted when a manifest is deleted.

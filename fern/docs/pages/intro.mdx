NaviPartner's REST API serves as a robust interface for accessing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, enabling seamless integration and 
interaction with its backend services. 
This documentation provides an overview of our API, its architecture, authentication mechanisms, and best practices for usage.

### Overview of the REST API
Our REST API is designed to facilitate efficient communication between external applications and the Business Central backend. 
Although Business Central primarily offers an OData API with limited POST methods, NaviPartner leverages a reverse proxy architecture. 
This setup exposes a comprehensive REST API to the public, which internally translates requests to the Business Central OData endpoints. 
This approach allows us to provide a full-fledged RESTful experience, enabling developers to perform standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
in a manner consistent with REST principles.

### Key Features

- **Full REST Capabilities**: Despite Business Central's OData limitations, our API provides full CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (CRUD) operations.
- **Reverse Proxy Architecture**: We utilize a sophisticated reverse proxy system to translate between REST and OData, ensuring you can work with familiar REST conventions.
- **Seamless Integration**: Our API acts as a transparent layer, allowing you to interact with Business Central data and processes as if you were using a native REST API.
- **Enhanced Security**: Authentication is handled directly against the Business Central instance, ensuring robust security measures are in place.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of the rate limits set for the API to avoid throttling and ensure fair usage across all users.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust [error handling](./errors.mdx) in your applications to gracefully manage API errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.

## How It Works

1. **Client Request**: Your application sends a standard REST API request to our endpoint.
2. **Reverse Proxy**: Our reverse proxy receives the request and translates it into the appropriate OData format.
3. **Business Central Interaction**: The translated request is sent to the Business Central OData endpoint.
4. **Response Processing**: The OData response is received, unwrapped, and converted back into a REST-friendly format.
5. **Client Response**: The REST-formatted response is sent back to your application.

This process happens seamlessly and quickly, providing you with the ease of use of a REST API while leveraging the power of Business Central's backend.

## Getting Started

To begin using the NaviPartner REST API:

1. [Make sure you have access to a Business Central instance](#) (link to registration/login process)
2. [Review our authentication guide](./auth.mdx)
3. [Explore the available endpoints](/api-reference)
4. [Check out our code samples](#) (link to code examples)

We're excited to see what you'll build with NaviPartner's REST API. Happy coding!

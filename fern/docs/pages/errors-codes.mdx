This document provides descriptions for various error codes used in the system.

## The Error Body
All errors have a unified error body that include a code and message property.

Here's an example of a JSON error response body error:

```json
{
  "code": "generic_error",
  "message": "Http method OPTIONS is not supported."
}
```

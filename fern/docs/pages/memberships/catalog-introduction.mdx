The catalog endpoints serve as the foundation for a headless setup, offering a centralized way to access essential information about the available types of memberships. 

Key Concepts:

    * Store Code Parameter:
        The store code acts as a filter, allowing the system to tailor the available ticket information to a specific 
        sales channel or store front. Each store or sales channel may have its own unique set of memberships
        and the store code ensures that only the relevant subset of catalog items are returned. 
        This is particularly useful in cases where different platforms, regions, or partners require distinct offerings.

    * Localized Storefront:
        The store front is typically designed to target a specific language or region. 
        As a result, the catalog endpoint ensures that ticket information is delivered in the appropriate language for 
        the store's target audience. By supporting multiple languages, the system can accommodate global users 
        while ensuring that the presentation and messaging are localized.

    * Formatted Content Fields:
        The catalog also supports two fields that can include HTML styling and formatting. 
        These fields provide flexibility for content presentation, allowing rich text formatting such as bold text, 
        lists, links, or other HTML elements. 
        This ensures that the ticket descriptions or other important information can be presented in an 
        engaging and readable way, enhancing the user experience across different devices or platforms. 
        It also allows ticket sellers to include more detailed or visually appealing descriptions 
        without requiring separate design templates for each store.

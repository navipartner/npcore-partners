Attributes are key-value pairs that can be associated with both Memberships and Member entities. They provide a flexible way to store additional information without modifying the core data model. Each attribute consists of a unique key and a corresponding value, allowing you to extend the functionality and store custom data as needed.

The main functions for working with attributes include:

- **List**: Discover attributes available for a specific entity, returning an array of attribute keys (code) and the related data types, description, captions.
- **Get**: Fetch the current set of attributes for an entity.
- **Set**: Add or update one or more attributes by providing an array of key-value pairs.
- **Delete**: Remove one or more attributes from an entity by specifying their keys.

These operations enable dynamic customization and management of Memberships and Members, supporting a wide range of use cases and integrations.

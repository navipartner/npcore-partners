The card endpoints are designed to manage the lifecycle and actions related to member cards within a membership. These endpoints enable you to add new cards, replace existing ones, and retrieve card details by ID or number. They also allow for operational actions such as registering a memberâ€™s arrival at a facility using their card or printing a physical card for use.

The member endpoints are designed to manage the lifecycle and details of individual members within a membership. These endpoints allow for adding new members to a membership, retrieving member information by ID or number, and managing member access and status through actions like blocking or unblocking. Additionally, member details can be updated, images can be retrieved or set, and members can be searched based on various criteria.

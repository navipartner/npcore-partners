The following limits apply **per Entra App**:

| Limit | Description | Value |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Max body size | The maximum request body size in MB. | 350 |
| Max concurrent requests | The maximum number of requests that can be processed at the same time. Requests that exceed this limit wait in a queue until a slot becomes available. Requests timeout after 8 minutes, returning HTTP 503 | 5 |
| Max connections | The maximum number of simultaneous requests, including processed and queued requests. Exceeding this limit returns HTTP 429 | 100 |
| Max request queue size | The maximum number of queued requests waiting to be processed. Exceeding this limit returns HTTP 429| 95 |
| Speed (rate) | The maximum number of requests that can be submitted within a 5-minute sliding window. Exceeding this limit returns HTTP 429 | 6000 |
| Operation timeout | The maximum request timeout in minutes, returning HTTP 408. | 8 |


## Retry strategy
Your integration should be resilient to temporary failures, HTTP 429 and HTTP 503.  
Exponential backoff is our recommended strategy for retrying requests.


## Increase throughput
If you need more throughput than the limits allow, you can create multiple Entra Apps and spread your requests across them.

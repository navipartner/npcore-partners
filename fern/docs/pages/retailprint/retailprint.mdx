Generate print jobs for price labels in batch. Ideal for warehouse management systems and retail operations.

## Item Identification

Items can be identified using either method (but not both):

- **EAN/Barcode**: Automatically resolves to Item No. and Variant Code
- **Item No. + Variant Code**: Direct item specification (useful when barcodes are duplicated)

<Warning>
Each item must use exactly one identification method. You cannot specify both `ean` and `itemNo` for the same item.
</Warning>

## Layout Types

- **PrintTemplate**: Returns printer metadata (`printerType` and `device`) along with the print job
- **Codeunit**: Returns only the print job data

<Note>
This endpoint returns base64-encoded print job data. You'll need to send this data to your printer using a printing service (e.g., PrintNode).

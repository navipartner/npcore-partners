The **Retail Print API** enables batch printing operations for retail environments. Generate print jobs for price labels with flexible item identification and layout options.

## Key Features

- **Batch Processing**: Print multiple labels in a single API call
- **Flexible Item Identification**: Use EAN/barcode or Item No. with optional Variant Code
- **Layout Support**: Codeunit-based and Print Template layouts
- **Base64 Output**: Returns print job data ready to send to printers

## Required Permissions

The `NPR API RetailPrint` permission set must be assigned to the user account.

<Note>
This API returns base64-encoded print job data. You'll need to send this to your printer using a printing service (e.g., PrintNode).

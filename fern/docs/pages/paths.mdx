description: Describes how to correctly build API URL.
---

## Overview
Our API uses a set of global path parameters that must be included in every request to ensure that they are routed to you the correct destination. 

<Note>You can grab the proper values from Business Central by searching for page "NaviPartner API URL". It will contain the proper URL for the currently opened environment</Note>

## Required Parameters

When navigating our portal you will notice that every API request must include the following three path parameters in the order specified:
1. `tenant`
2. `environment`
3. `company`

### 1. Tenant
- **Type**: String (UUID format)
- **Description**: A unique identifier for the Entra ID tenant that the Business Central environment lives in.

### 2. Environment

- **Type**: String
- **Description**: Specifies which environment of the Business Central tenant you want to access.

### 3. Company

- **Type**: String
- **Description**: The name of the specific company within the chosen Business Central environment.

<Note>More information how to work with companies can be found [here](/systemservices/companies).</Note>

## URL Structure

The general structure of the API URL including these parameters is:

```
https://api.npretail.app/{tenant}/{environment}/{company}/[endpoint]
```

## Example

Here's an example of how these parameters might look in a full API request URL:

```
https://api.npretail.app/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012/production/CRONUS%20International%20Ltd./configurations
```

In this example:
- `tenant` is `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`
- `environment` is `production`
- `company` is `CRONUS International Ltd.` (URL-encoded in the actual request)
- The specific endpoint being accessed is `configurations`

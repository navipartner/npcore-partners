The Attraction Wallet is a digital platform designed to centralize and simplify the management of tickets and access credentials for attractions, events, or theme parks. It serves as a secure repository for storing essential data such as tickets, coupons, vouchers, and even member cards.

A key feature of the Attraction Wallet is its integration with speed gates. When the wallet is swiped at a speed gate, the system quickly identifies and selects the correct asset configured for that particular entry point. This smart configuration not only streamlines the entry process but also ensures that the appropriate ticket or voucher is used, minimizing errors and enhancing security. The seamless operation with speed gates reduces wait times, improves overall efficiency, and provides a flexible solution that can be tailored to the specific needs of different attractions or events.

The schedule API is responsible for displaying all available schedule entries visible on web for specified time period.

Key Concepts:

    * Admissions: 
        Admissions define the specific areas or events a ticket grants access to. 
        Each admission has a unique admission code, along with descriptive information and various predefined limits, 
        such as capacity or entry restrictions. These limits and policies can be set at different hierarchical levels, 
        allowing flexibility in how capacity is controlled.

    * Time-Based Validity: 
        In addition to defining what a ticket allows access to, the admission must also specify when the access is valid. 
        Every admission needs to be linked to a specific time slot to ensure proper scheduling. 
        In cases where the time is not explicitly provided, the system may assign a time slot automatically (defined by setup), 
        which is particularly useful for scenarios like walk-up ticket sales at kiosks, 
        where tickets should be valid immediately upon purchase.

    * Time Slot Visibility: All web available time slots are displayed to the consumer, even if they are no longer 
        allocatable (e.g., fully booked or sold out). This is intentional, as it allows the system to provide 
        visibility into popular events, offering a sense of urgency or exclusivity that can drive consumer interest.
    
    * Schedules: 
        Admission schedules define when a location will be open or when an event will be occurring. 
        Multiple schedules can be applied to the same admission object. The setup defines how these entries
        should be generated based on available rules. Only one entry per date is permitted,
        so automatic rescheduling is possible if the schedule definition changes.

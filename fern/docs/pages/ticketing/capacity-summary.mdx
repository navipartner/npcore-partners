The capacity API is responsible for managing the availability of access to a specific admission at a designated time, 
ensuring the system can allocate resources for a ticket reservation.

Key Concepts:
    * Item Number: 
        This represents the product being sold at a high level. 
        Each item number corresponds to a category or type of ticket, and the base price is associated with 
        the item number. The base price is drawn from a general price list that applies across all similar items.

    * Admissions: 
        Admissions define the specific areas or events a ticket grants access to. 
        Each admission has a unique admission code, along with descriptive information and various predefined limits, 
        such as capacity or entry restrictions. These limits and policies can be set at different hierarchical levels, 
        allowing flexibility in how capacity is controlled.

    * Time-Based Validity: 
        In addition to defining what a ticket allows access to, the admission must also specify when the access is valid. 
        Every admission needs to be linked to a specific time slot to ensure proper scheduling. 
        In cases where the time is not explicitly provided, the system may assign a time slot automatically (defined by setup), 
        which is particularly useful for scenarios like walk-up ticket sales at kiosks, 
        where tickets should be valid immediately upon purchase.

    * Dynamic Pricing: 
        Each time slot can independently manage its pricing. 
        While the base price is determined by the item number, time slots can either use a fixed price or 
        apply dynamic pricing adjustments to the base price based on demand, capacity, or other factors.

    * Time Slot Visibility: All available time slots are displayed to the consumer, even if they are no longer 
        allocatable (e.g., fully booked or sold out). This is intentional, as it allows the system to provide 
        visibility into popular events, offering a sense of urgency or exclusivity that can drive consumer interest.

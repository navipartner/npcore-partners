### Reservations: The Reservation Lifecycle

The ticket reservation system manages the entire lifecycle of a ticket, from initial creation to confirmation, 
cancellation, and validation. When a reservation is made, the system returns a token that can be used to 
retrieve details and perform further actions like updates or cancellations. 
This token expires after a set period, and tickets are not valid until confirmed. 

The item number is a key identifier that represents the type of product being sold (i.e., the ticket) 
and is used to determine its base price from a general price list. 

### Ticket: Admission and Access Control

Each ticket grants access to one or more admissions, which are sections or events a user can attend. 
For tickets to be valid, they must specify not only what the holder can access but also when they can access it. 

### Capacity: Availability and Time Slots

The capacity API handles the availability of tickets for specific admissions at defined times. 
Admissions represent the areas or events a ticket allows access to and are identified by unique codes. 
To be valid, a ticket must be linked to a time slot that defines when it can be used. 
Even sold-out or non-allocatable time slots are shown to indicate popularity and scarcity.
Dynamic pricing allows for time slots to have variable prices based on demand.

### Catalog: The store front 

The catalog endpoints provide access to essential ticket information for headless setups, 
offering a flexible entry point for different sales channels. The store code acts as a 
filter to display a subset of tickets tailored to a specific sales channel or platform, 
allowing for customized offers. The store fronts are usually localized by language, and 
certain fields support HTML formatting for enhanced presentation of ticket details.

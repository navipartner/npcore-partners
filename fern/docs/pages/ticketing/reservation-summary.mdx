The Reservation API is designed to manage the lifecycle of reservations for tickets. 

## Key Concepts

- Reservation Token: A unique identifier assigned to each reservation. This token is used in most operations to reference a specific reservation.
- Reservation States: A reservation can be in different states, such as:
  * "registered" (initially created)
  * "confirmed" (finalized)
  * "cancelled"
  * "expired"
- Expiration: Reservations have a limited lifespan to prevent indefinite holds on tickets. Cancelled and Expired reservation will be purged from the system.
- Item Numbers: These represent specific products or ticket types in the system.
- Admission Codes and Schedule IDs: These are used to specify particular admissions and time slots for reservations.

## Overview

There are 4 steps to selling a ticket.
<AccordionGroup>
    
    <Accordion title="1 - Decide which ticket">
        Query the <code>/ticketing/catalog/</code> endpoint:
        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /ticketing/catalog/{storeCode}" example="ExampleCatalog1" /> 
        We are primarily interested in the <code>itemNumber</code> field values
        <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /ticketing/catalog/{storeCode}" example="ExampleCatalog1"/> 
    </Accordion>
    

    <Accordion title="2 - Find and select a time slot">
        Next we need to find time slots for the admission codes that are included with the selected product. 
        For that purpose we will use the <code>/ticketing/capacity/search</code> endpoint.

        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /ticketing/capacity/search" example="ExampleCapacity1"/> 

        From the response, user must select a suitable time slot. We need the <code>code</code> ("CASTLE") and <code>schedule.id</code> (452)
        values to be able to create the reservation in the next step.  
        <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /ticketing/capacity/search" example="ExampleCapacity1"/> 
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="3 - Create the reservation">
        To make a reservation we need to know the <code>itemNumber</code>, <code>admissionCode</code> and <code>scheduleId</code>
        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /ticketing/reservation" example="ExampleCreateReservation1"/> 

        If the reservation is successful, we will get a reservation in return. As long as the reservation is valid, our tickets are guaranteed.
        For subsequent references to this reservation we need the reservation <code>token</code>.
        <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /ticketing/reservation" example="ExampleCreateReservation1"/> 

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="4 - Confirm the reservation">
        Tickets are not valid until the reservation has been confirmed. To confirm a reservation we use the <code>/ticketing/reservation/:token/confirm</code> endpoint.
        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /ticketing/reservation/:token/confirm" example="ExampleConfirmReservation1"/> 
        The response object contains the ticket with ticket numbers that are valid for admission.
        <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /ticketing/reservation/:token/confirm" example="ExampleConfirmReservation1"/> 
    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Overview

There are 5 steps to selling a ticket. This step by step guide below with examples will take you through the process: 
<AccordionGroup>
    
    <Accordion title="1 - Decide which ticket">
        First, query the available tickets catalog to find a product that fits the needs. This is done using the `/ticketing/catalog/` endpoint.
        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/catalog/:storeCode" example="ExampleCatalog1" /> 
        
        Use the `itemNumber` to specify your chosen ticket in later steps.
        <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/catalog/:storeCode" example="ExampleCatalog1"/> 
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="2 - Find and select a time slot">
        Next we need to find time slots for the admission codes that are included with the selected product. 
        For that purpose we will use the `/ticketing/capacity/search` endpoint.

        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/capacity/search" example="ExampleCapacity1"/> 

        From the response, user must select a suitable time slot. We need the `code` ("CASTLE") and `schedule.id` (452)
        values to be able to create the reservation in the next step.  
        <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/capacity/search" example="ExampleCapacity1"/> 
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="3 - Create the reservation">
        To make a reservation we need to know the `itemNumber` (from step 1), `admissionCode` and `scheduleId` from step 2
        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/reservation" example="ExampleCreateReservation1"/> 

        If the reservation is successful, we will get a reservation token in return. As long as the reservation is valid, our tickets are guaranteed.
        For subsequent references to this reservation we need the reservation `token`.
        <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/reservation" example="ExampleCreateReservation1"/> 
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="4 - Confirm the reservation">
        Tickets are reserved but not valid until the reservation has been confirmed. To confirm a reservation we use the `/ticketing/reservation/:token/confirm` endpoint.
        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/reservation/:token/confirm" example="ExampleConfirmReservation1"/>

        The response object contains the ticket numbers that are created and valid for admission.
        <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="POST /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/reservation/:token/confirm" example="ExampleConfirmReservation1"/> 
    </Accordion>


    <Accordion title="5 - Ticket information">
        Finally, the full ticket information can be accessed.
        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/ticket/:ticketNumber"/>

        The response contain all relevant ticket details:
        <EndpointResponseSnippet endpoint="GET /:saasguid/:saasenv/:company/ticketing/ticket/:ticketNumber" example="ExampleGetTicket"/> 

    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

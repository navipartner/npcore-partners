# GDPR Anonymization
---

Use this endpoint to initiate GDPR-compliant anonymization of customer data. The API creates an anonymization request after validating eligibility (e.g., no active memberships or blocking conditions) and returns a status message.

## Single Flexible Endpoint

The GDPR anonymization API uses a **single POST endpoint** with a flexible request body that supports three different ways to identify the customer:

### Option 1: Customer Number Only
Send only the customer number for **company-level anonymization**:
```json
{
  "customerNo": "C00001"
}
```
Use this when you don't need to specify a contact person.

### Option 2: Customer + Contact Number
Send both customer number and contact number for **person-level anonymization**:
```json
{
  "customerNo": "C00001",
  "contactNo": "CT00001"
}
```
Use this when the customer is linked to a specific contact person.

### Option 3: Email Address Only
Send only the email address to look up the customer:
```json
{
  "email": "customer@example.com"
}
```

## Notes and Constraints

- The anonymization process is **irreversible** once executed by the back office job
- Customers with active/confirmed memberships or certain dependencies may be ineligible
- If ineligible, the response includes a reason code in the message
- When using email lookup, customer records must exist

## Response Format

The API returns a response that echoes back the identifier(s) you provided:
- `success`: boolean indicating if the request was created
- `message`: detailed description of the result
- `customerNo`: included when applicable
- `contactNo`: included when provided in the request
- `email`: included when using email-based lookup

## Endpoint

- **POST** `/customer/requestAnonymize`

All our endpoints use header **`x-api-version`** to specify which version of the API a client wants to interact with.  

When you develop your integration you should set this header to be the current date. This ensures that future versions with potential breaking changes will not impact you.  
If you omit the header, you will always get the latest version.

## Header Format
The format of the header should be `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Companies in Business Central

In Business Central, **Companies** serve as data envelopes, encapsulating all the data and business logic execution relevant to a specific organizational unit. 
Each company operates as a separate environment within Business Central, with its own set of data tables. 
This structure allows multiple companies to coexist within a single Business Central database (environment), while keeping their data isolated and secure.

### How Companies Work in API Calls

When interacting with Business Central via REST API calls, it's crucial to [specify the company](./../paths.mdx#url-structure) in which the request should be executed. 
The company is typically identified by a path segment in the API call, ensuring that the operation is performed within the correct data context. 
For example, if you want to retrieve customers from a specific company, the API call must include the appropriate company identifier in the path.

### REST API Feature: `Companies` Endpoint

Our REST API provides a convenient endpoint called `Companies` that allows clients to retrieve a list of all available companies within the Business Central database. 
This feature is particularly useful for all applications that need to be aware of the companies they can interact with.

#### GET /companies

The [Companies](/companies/get-companies) endpoint responds to `GET` requests with a list of companies. Here's what the request looks like:

```http
GET https://api.navipartner.app/tenant-id/environment-name/companies
```

<Warning>This endpoint is an exception in terms of routing, as it does not use the global path segment named `company`.</Warning>


### Response

The response from the Companies endpoint will look like this:

```
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "17ff1351-d07d-4b85-8957-b4b585f47aad",
      "systemVersion": "24.0.16410.18056",
      "name": "CRONUS International Ltd.",
      "displayName": ""
    },
    {
      "id": "872336d7-5183-4c0b-9b47-755f3d6d77e7",
      "systemVersion": "24.0.16410.18056",
      "name": "TestCompany",
      "displayName": "TestCompany"
    }
  ]
}
```

 - `name`: The system name of the company. This holds the value that is relevant for all API calls.
 - `displayName`: The display name of the company (if different from the internal name, can be eventually empty).


### Using the Company Information

Once the client application retrieves the list of companies, it can use one of the returned company names to make subsequent API calls. 
This ensures that all operations are correctly targeted at the appropriate company, maintaining data integrity and ensuring that the application's business logic operates in the correct context.

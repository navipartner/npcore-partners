title: API Key
slug: auth

You'll need two things to authorize against our APIs:
- An Entra App for your integration with the proper permissions defined.
- An Authorization library for your language of choice:

## Create Entra App with permissions via our wizard
<Warning>This wizard can only be used by a user that is an Entra ID Global Administrator. The wizard will create a single-tenant Entra app on your behalf and ask for the required admin consent</Warning>

1. Search for page "Microsoft Entra Applications" in Business Central and open it.
2. Click "Actions" -> "Entra App Management" -> "Create Entra App"
3. Fill in "Application Name" based on the purpose and/or vendor that will be using the integration. 
4. Select the permissions below that the API Key should have. You will typically find 1 permission per API group in our portal i.e. "POS", "Memberships", etc.
5. Click on action "Create Microsoft Entra Application" 
6. Approve the consent request.
7. Write down the client_id and client_secret as you will not be able to retrieve the client_secret again afterwards.
8. Develop your integration :)

## OAuth config:
When acquiring a token with Entra ID, you'll need a few parameters, along with your client_id and client_secret:
- Scope should be "https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/.default" 
- The URL to acquire a token is "https://login.microsoftonline.com/:tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token"

If you need to test in Postman, you can do so using their OAuth 2.0 authentication feature with the following parameters:
- Authorization to OAuth 2.0
- Grant type to "Client Credentials"
- Scope to "https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/.default" 
- Token URL to "https://login.microsoftonline.com/:tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token"

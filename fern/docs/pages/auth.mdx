In this article we will explain how to create an API Key and link it to one or more Entra ID Applications that can access your Business Central instance.

<Steps>
    <Step title="1. Create the API Key">
        1. From the **NaviPartner API Keys** page in your Business Central environment, select the **Create new API Key** action from the action bar.
        2. Provide a descriptive **Name** for your key (e.g., "E-commerce Integration") in the dialog and click **OK**.
        3. A new API key will be generated and displayed. **This is the only time the key will be shown.** Copy it immediately and store it in a secure location like a password manager or secrets vault.
    </Step>
    <Step title="2. Assign Permissions">
        1. Select the newly created key in the main list.
        2. In the **NaviPartner API Key Permissions** section at the bottom of the page, add the permission sets required for your integration. These define what endpoints the key is allowed to access.
    </Step>
    <Step title="3. Register one or more Entra ID Apps">
        <Warning>
            This step must be performed by a user with administrative privileges in Entra ID (Azure Active Directory), such as a **Global Administrator**. The wizard requires granting admin consent for the new application on behalf of the organization, and this cannot be done later.
        </Warning>
        Your API key needs at least one Entra ID application linked to it, before it can access Business Central.
        1. With the new key selected, click the **Register new Entra App** action in the action bar.
        2. A wizard will guide you through creating and linking a new Entra ID application. You will be prompted to grant consent during this process.
        3. Once complete, the new Entra Application will appear in the **NaviPartner API Key Entra Application List** FactBox on the right.
        4. For high-volume integrations, you can repeat this process to create and link multiple Entra Applications to your API key. Our gateway will automatically load-balance requests across them when you use your API key.
    </Step>
    <Step title="4. Use your API key">
        Include the API key in the `x-np-api-key` header on your HTTP requests.  
        If you ever encounter HTTP 429 or 503 in the wild, you can go back and create more Entra ID Applications on your existing API key to increase the throughput.
    </Step>

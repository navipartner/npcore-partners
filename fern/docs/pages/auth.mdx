[Authentication](./auth.mdx) is a critical aspect of our API. When you authenticate:

1. Your credentials are securely passed through to the Business Central instance.
2. Business Central validates your credentials and permissions.
3. Upon successful authentication, you're granted access to the API resources you're authorized to use.

This ensures that all security protocols and access controls configured in Business Central are respected and enforced.

Before starting balancing tests you need to have multiple currencies payment (EUR, USD, SEK and DKK)

Please make sure you have layout with a name of Default as it will be used for fallback layout during cleanup.

Please make sure you don't have any E2E Testing named layouts before starting the tests.

Since we are using 3 workers to run tests you must create 4 users and assign them different POS units, add them in ENV file like this: 
E2E_USER_0_USERNAME=TEST-USER
E2E_USER_0_PASSWORD=Test-user-0

E2E_USER_1_USERNAME=TEST-USER-1
E2E_USER_1_PASSWORD=Test-user-1

E2E_USER_2_USERNAME=TEST-USER-2
E2E_USER_2_PASSWORD=Test-user-2

For restaurant tests we need default user that has restaurant POS unit, with restaurant default view: 
E2E_RESTAURANT_USERNAME=username
E2E_RESTAURANT_PASSWORD=password

Last user should not have layout selected so it can run old MPOS tests:
E2E_OLD_MPOS_USERNAME=username
E2E_OLD_MPOS_PASSWORD=password

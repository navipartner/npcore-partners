# POS (Point of Sale) units

POS units are a central part of the POS sales solution. They consist of hardware and software elements that enable services and item sale transactions at retail locations. The transactions can be recorded and a receipt can be printed out or sent to the buyer via email or text.   
   
Each business has multiple operation categories, regardless of its size (payment processing, logistics, appointment management, procuring materials, and so on). It's much more efficient to automatize these operations and eliminate mistakes if you're using POS units and POS systems.

POS units are also capable or tracking the real-time status of the shop's inventory and recording transactions on paper or spreadsheets, helping strategize marketing efforts and boost sales.

In brief, the POS units help streamline retail operations by automating the transaction process and tracking important sales data.

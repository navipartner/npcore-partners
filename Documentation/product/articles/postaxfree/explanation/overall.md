# POS Tax Free services

The purpose of retail tax free services is to provide an easy flow for tourists leaving the EU with their purchased goods to declare them at the airport and receive the tax refund.
There are various POS Tax Free services on the market - today, NPRetail integrates directly with two of them, with more integrations on the way.  

Common to all of them is that they can detect foreign credit cards by matching on the IIN (first 6 digits of the card number), and receive receipt information from NPRetail in return for a tax free voucher that is printed and handed to the end customer.
These tax free providers act as the middle-man between the shopper and the shop - they make sure that all country specific compliance is met and handle the tax refund transactions to the shopper accounts while clearing the amounts with the shop later.
A fee of the tax refund amount is taken in return for the service provided by the tax free service provider.

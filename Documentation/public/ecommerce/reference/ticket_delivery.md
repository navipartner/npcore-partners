# Ticket Delivery (reference guide)

The following options are available in regards to the ticket delivery:

| Field name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Email Delivery** | It can be turned off, or be a part of the separate email or order confirmation. It's advised to have it as a separate ticket email. You can also add **BCC recipients** in this case. The **E-Ticket (Passes) in Email** can be set as a link, or as an attachment. So, the ticket could be reordered in the email as a link, or as an attachment. |
| **Type-Specific Email Template** | This is the place where you can assign an email template to the specific ticket type. |
| **SMS Delivery** | Enables having the ticket delivered in SMS. The option is heavily dependent on Business Central. Preliminary setup needs to be performed in Business Central for this to become effective. |
| **Ticket Generation** | There are two features: **E-Ticket (Pass)** - this one should be left as-is because the options here are governed through Business Central; **Ticket** card - in it, you can define whether you want the ticket to be generated from the Ticket Designer template, or as a default one. |

> [!Note]
> Even though the Ticket Designer (**NaviPartner** > **Entertainment** > **Ticket Designer**) isn't described in this guide, it's important to note that the **Ticket Type** that is configured in Business Central is in correlation with the **Ticket Code Type** from the Ticket Designer.  
For example, if you purchase the ticket with the **EVENT** ticket type in Business Central, then you will receive the ticket design that is related to that same ticket code type from the Ticket Designer.

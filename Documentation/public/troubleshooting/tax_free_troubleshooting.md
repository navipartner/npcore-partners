# Tax-free troubleshooting

#### I forgot to enable tax-free before finalizing the sale. How can I reprint the voucher?

If you forgot to enable tax-free before finalizing the sale or if you want to reprint the voucher, you can do so from the **Audit Roll** by selecting the correct sale, and clicking **Tax Free** under **Actions**.

> [!Note]
> If no vouchers associated with the selected sale can be found, you can issue a new one. If you do so, the creation process will be the same as when done from the POS, and the voucher will be printed. You can also reprint the existing vouchers from the **Tax Free Vouchers** page by clicking **Print Voucher** while selecting the correct line.

# Coupon troubleshooting

#### Is it possible to create multiple coupons that pertain to a single customer?       

Yes. After you've created a coupon and added the customer number in the **Customer No.** field, open the relevant **Coupon Type Card**, and activate the **Multi-Use Coupon** toggle switch. Then write the number of coupons you want to issue for the specific customer in the **Multi-Use Qty.** field. Note that multi-use coupons option is used for creating multiple coupons with the same number.

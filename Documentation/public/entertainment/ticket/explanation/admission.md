# Ticket Admission

A **Ticket Admission** defines what a ticket is valid for. 

The admission **Type** determines whether it can be used for a location or an event. 
A location is typically physical, like a museum, while an event is something within the location, such as a guided tour.
Ticket types work in the same way, but there are a few exceptions. A key difference is that a ticket for an event admission is valid for a specific time only, while location admissions are open and thus valid for any time within a larger timeframe.

> [!NOTE]
> Each ticket needs to include at least one ticket admission.

# Ticket Statistics and Forecast
For tickets there are several means for statistics.  
Two flexible multidimensional access statistics pages are available in the **Report and Analysis** section.

- **Ticket Access Statistics Matrix**
- **Admission Forecast Matrix**

The two reports will give an overview on *what have happened* and what *will happen*.

## Ticket Access Statistics Matrix

The Ticket Access Statistics Matrix is a precise method for seeing the correct number for valid admissions recorded (e.g. scanning the ticket upon arrival). 
The aggregated data is persistent and will not change over time, as opposed to how the flow filters works (like **Admission Forecast Matrix** underneath), so you must create a new sum every time to execute a new report.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you do not scan the tickets no data will be avaliable. 

In the **Matrix** you choose x (lines) and y (columns) axis. Avaliable data present are ticket **items** and data from the ticket module (**Ticket type, Admission Data, Admission Hour, Period, Admission Code and Variant Code**)

In **Metrics** you will see the **Metrix Total** calculated when the report is generated or updated as well at setting the components that provides the specifications for the quantitative measurements e.g. how the admission count should be defined and time specifications amd trend periods. 

In **Matrix Filters** you can filter the General data with e.g. setting a specific **item** filter (so you won't see all ticket item numbers), **ticket type** and **date and hour** as well as **Admission Codes** and **Variants**. 



## Admission Forecast Matrix

The **Admission Forecast Matrix** is a quick and precise tool for you to get an overview on how your ticket admission is doing according to sales, reservations, utilization, and capacity.

Choose the admission code for the ticket you wish to see admission data from.
> [!NOTE]
> All ticket schedules connected to the Admission Code will show up in the list.

In **Display Options** you can choose between:
- **Sales**; shows the amount of sold tickets posted 
- **Reservations**; shows confirmed reservations
- **Utilization pct.**; shows how many percentage of the admission has been utilized (0% to 100%).
- **Capacity pct.**; shows how much of the admissions capacity is left in percentage (100% to 0%).

In **Periodtype** you then choose between:  
- **Actual**; only the days visiual with admissions set.
- **Day**; all calendar days.
- **Week**; all tickets cumulated by week numbers.
- **Month**; all tickets cumulated by month.
- **Quarter**; all tickets cumulated by quarter.
- **Year**; all tickets cumulated by year.

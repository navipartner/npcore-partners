# Set up refund policy

Ticket refund policy is set up in the **Ticket BOM** page. By default, only unused admissions are refunded.

Navigate to the **Ticket BOM**, and then to the **Revoke Policy** column.

Here you can pick between three options for the refund policy:

- **Unused Admission** - default option (until used).
- **Never Allow** - makes it impossible to revoke the ticket.
- **Always Allow** - makes it always possible to revoke the ticket.

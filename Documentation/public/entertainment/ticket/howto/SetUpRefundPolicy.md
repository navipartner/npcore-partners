# Set up refund policy

Ticket refund policy is set up in the **Ticket BOM** page. By default, only unused admissions are refunded.

Go to the **Ticket BOM** and then go to the **Revoke Policy** column.

Here you can pick between three options for the refund policy:
-	**Unused Admission;** default option (until used)
-	**Never Allow;** it is not possible to revoke the ticket
-	**Always Allow;** you can always revoke the ticket

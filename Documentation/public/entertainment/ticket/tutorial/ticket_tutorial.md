# Setting up tickets using the ticket wizard

This tutorial will teach you how to create the setup for a fully functional ticket.

2. On the **Ticket Setup** page, choose the **Ticket Wizard** action.

The **Ticket Wizard** will now open
1.	Fill in code for **Ticket Type**. You can either choose an existing ticket type or create a new one.
> [!NOTE] 
> You can create a new Ticket Type in the ticket wizard by typing the wanted name in the Code and then fill out the text fields for Ticket Type in **Advanced**.
2.	In **No.** field, write the item number of your choice. By default, a generic next-in-line item number will be generated and set to **< GENERATE >**. This will generate a generic next-in-line item number. But this can be changed to an item number of your choice. 
3.	Fill in **Description** with the description for your ticket.
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This description will also be the name on the webshop. You can however change this in the Item Card under the Magento tab.
4.	Choose the **Item Group** for your ticket.
5.	Fill out the **Unit Price** for the ticket.
6.	Pick the **Start Date**.

9.	Set the **Stop Time**.
10.	Now check off which **weekdays** the tickets will take place on. 
> [!NOTE] 
> You can create several schedule lines if needed with different start and stop times and different weekdays, but still within the start and until date.
11.	Set your capacity control (For capacity control by amount the capacity will usually be set to **Sales**, and for limited capacity it will be none.
12.	Set your **capacity amount** (How many tickets should be available)
13.	Set **prebook from**. This will determine how long in advance it should be possible to book the tickets. (e.g. 14D = 14 Days; 3M = Three months).
14.	In **Advanced** you can, like in point 1 & 2, choose whether you want **Admission Code** and **Ticket BOM** to generate a code automatically or want to create your own. 
15.	Choose if you want to check off **Prebook is required**. With this setting, a reservation is required and will be created on sales. Admission will only be allowed at the time specified on the reservation entry; Default schedule rule applies.
16.	Click **OK** and the ticket will be created.

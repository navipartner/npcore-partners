# Ticket module

The ticket module in NPRetail is used for managing tickets. A Ticket is an entity that links all properties and characteristics of a specific issued ticket. From a user's perspective, this represents the physical ticket that the user has acquired.

The ticket information structure is complex and consists of several entities which can present its capabilities and capture all events when a ticket is used.

# Ticket module

The ticket module in NPRetail offers an omnichannel solution for customers in the entertainment industry. A Ticket is an entity that links all properties and characteristics of a physically issued ticket with the Business Central database.

The ticket information structure is complex and consists of several entities which can present its capabilities and capture all events when a ticket is used. For that reason, setting up tickets for new customers requires them to know exactly what kind of setup they want to implement.

# Ticket module

The ticketing module offers an omnichannel solution for customers in the entertainment industry.

A ticket is an item that links all properties and characteristics of a physically issued ticket with the Business Central database. Once they're sold to customers, they provide them with access to museums, amusement parks, or specific reservations within some type of a venue, such as a museum guided tour. These tickets may or may not require reservations.

The ticket information structure is complex and consists of several entities which can present its capabilities and capture all events when a ticket is used. For that reason, setting up tickets for new customers requires them to know exactly what kind of setup they want to implement.

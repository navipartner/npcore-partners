# Membership module

NP Membership automates processes related to handling loyalty cards and memberships. With this module, you can create member clubs, manage memberships, create both physical and digital membership cards, and analyze membership statistics to improve your services. 

Membership module comprises the following main administrative sections: 

- [**Member Community**](reference/member_community.md) - This is the top level in the member and membership setup. It represents a club or association that is marketing the memberships. 
- **Membership Setup** - This setup contains rules that govern a specific membership in a community. The membership defines the benefits the member will be able to acquire. 
- **Membership Sales Setup** - Here, you can set up how memberships can be sold using different items in the POS or on the website. One aspect of membership is to sell a potential benefit to the customer that is valid for a specific amount of time. 
- **Membership Admission Setup** - In combination with the Ticket module, members can gain access to extra tickets, and have guests accompanying them for the visit, which can be configured in this section. 
- **Membership Alteration** - It is possible to send reminders/notifications to members due to different events. You cab schedule these notifications and reminders here.
- **Member Reminder Setup** - In this section, you can define how an already existing membership may be altered, both in terms of validity in time, and the type of membership that is currently active.
- **Member Limitation Setup** - Here, you can limit access for memberships to prevent misuse of cards.

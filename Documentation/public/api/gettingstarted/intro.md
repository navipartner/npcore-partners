# Webservice API 

## Introduction 
NPRetail is running on top of the Business Central platform which is developed and maintained by Microsoft.  
The newest versions of BC use the OData v4 standard to provide REST webservice APIs.  
The base application in the ERP system comes with a big set of APIs and NPRetail adds many additional APIs on top for NaviPartners modules.

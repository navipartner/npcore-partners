# Capture Service Setup (CS Setup)

Before you start using NP WMS, you need to configure the rules which define how it will work. This is done in the **CS Setup** administrative section.

CS setup options consist of the following sections:

- **General Setup** - general settings for the Capture Service.
- **Stock Take** - settings for the Stock Take module.
- **RFID** - settings related to the radio-frequency identification.
- **Ship & Receive** - settings related to posting of warehouse documents.
- **Price Calculation** - settings related to price calculation of an Item.
- **Search** - settings related to grouping of search results.
- **Worksheet** - settings related to the stock count.
- **Physical Inventory Counting** - settings related to the physical Inventory count.
- **Job Queue** - settings related to Job queue processing.
- **Azure Printing** - settings related to printing.

From **CS Setup** you can also set up [CS users](../howto/set-up-cs-users.md), devices, and mobile app UI.

> [!Note]
> You can also access one of the [logs](cs_logs.md) in **CS Setup** if you encounter unforeseen issues in the environment.

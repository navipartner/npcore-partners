# Warehouse and inventory putaways

Inventory and warehouse putaways represent inbound stock-related processes used when the stock is increased, and needs to be allocated accordingly. All items received in the warehouse are either subjected to the inventory or warehouse putaway.

A putaway process starts with placing a purchase order, sales return order, or a transfer order.  After the supply is received, and the necessary quality checks performed, you can start putting away the items into their designated spaces. 

> [!Note]
> The processes associated with inbound warehouse movements are: Purchase Orders, Transfer Orders, and Sales Returns. 

## Warehouse putaway

Warehouse putaway entails all processes that occur after a supply of goods from a vendor is received, but before it is stored away in the warehouse. Warehouse putaways can have more than one source document and two lines per an item or a purchase line.

> [!Note]
> This putaway method is more stable, and it helps reduce the movement through the facility, reducing the average pick cost per order. 

## Inventory putaway

Like the warehouse putaway, inventory putaway relates to processes of receiving and allocating the stock to the adequate storage spaces. There is a one-to-one relation between inventory putaways and the source documents related to them.

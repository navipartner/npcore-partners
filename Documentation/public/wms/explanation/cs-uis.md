# Capture service UIs

The Capture Service user interface (CS UI) setup section is used for defining the user interface on mobile devices. It consists of a header, in which you define the parameters for the display and lines where you add the texts and fields which need to be displayed on the mobile interface. 

> [!Note]
> There should be one **Start UI** for the company. By default, this is the LOGIN UI.

There are mainly 3 types of UIs:

1. Menus (type Selection List). 
    Used to create menu
    [example](../images/menu-type-ui.JPG)

2. Data List (type Data List).
    used to display a list of data e.g List of Locations, List of Warehouse Documents
    [example](../images/datalist-type-ui.JPG)

3. Data Input (type Data List Input)
    used to interact with the user. E.g Warehouse Pick document.

A UI is made up of 3 sections.

- The header part defines the type of UI.

- The detail part defines the fields to be displayed on the header part on the mobile device.

- The link to **Data Pattern Code** will defines the data displayed as lines on the mobile apps.



> [!Note]
> NaviPartner provides standard UIs which can be implemented and modified as per requirements of the users.

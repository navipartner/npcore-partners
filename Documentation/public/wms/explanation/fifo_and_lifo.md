# Inventory costing methods

Inventory management is a very important function for all product-oriented businesses. The costing method you chose can greatly impact the businesses' logistics, profitability, and income, so it's recommended to research how each of these can be used to maximize your profits. If you order a different quantity of items in several occasions, their prices may differ. Different costing methods can cater to different business use cases in which you will be required to assign the unit cost differently.

> As soon as you choose the costing method you wish to use, it will be applied to items automatically, so there will be no need for you to calculate anything.

## FIFO

The FIFO (first in, first out) inventory costing method entails selling the products ordered in the first batch first before selling the others. In this way, the price at which the first batch of items was purchased is taken into account until the entirety of the oldest order batch has been emptied out. By employing this method businesses are at a smaller risk of losing money when products expire or become obsolete.

> [!Tip]
> The cost of the oldest inventory is multiplied by the number of inventory items sold. 


## LIFO

For the LIFO (last in, first out) inventory valuation method, the current prices are used to calculate the price of sold goods. It's best to apply this method for calculating prices of the non-perishable goods. Under LIFO, it's expected to sell the newest inventory first (the last purchased batch).

> [!Tip]
> The cost of the most recent inventory is multiplied by the amount of inventory sold.

## Standard

In the standard costing method, regardless of the item stock purchase cost and item quantity, the fixed standard cost will be used for all items. Due to the standard cost being fixed, the profit margin stays the same. 

> [!Tip]
> The **Standard Cost** is defined in the **Cost & Posting** section of the **Item Card**.

When an adjustment entry is added to the **Item Journal** for a transaction which includes a standard cost, an error will be displayed if the **Unit Amount** contains a value that doesn't correspond to what you've defined in the **Item Card** for the **Standard Cost** of the item.

## Average

The average costing method requires setting up the period over which the average item price will be calculated as well as the average cost calculation type in the **Inventory Setup**.



## Specific

To apply the specific costing method, you first need to specify the **Item Tracking Code** (related to the serial number tracking). In this costing method, the price will always be tied to a specific item serial number. 

> [!Tip]
> The **Item Tracking Code** is defined in the **Item Tracking** section of the **Item Card**.

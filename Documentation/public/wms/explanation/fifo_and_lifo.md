# Inventory costing methods

Inventory management is a very important function for all product-oriented businesses. The valuation approach you chose can greatly impact the businesses' logistics, profitability, and income, so it's recommended to research how each of these can be used to maximize your profits.

The FIFO (first in, first out) inventory valuation method entails selling the products ordered in the first batch first before selling the others. In this way, the price at which the first batch of items was purchased is taken into account until the entirety of the oldest order batch has been emptied out. By employing this method businesses are at a smaller risk of losing money when products expire or become obsolete.

To determine the costs associated with the inventory sales performed with FIFO, you need to determine the cost of the oldest inventory, and then multiply the cost by the number of inventory items sold. 

For the LIFO (last in, first out) inventory valuation method, the current prices are used to calculate the price of sold goods. It's best to apply this method for calculating prices of the non-perishable goods. Under LIFO, it's expected to sell the newest inventory first (the last purchased batch).

For LIFO calculation, you need to determine the cost of the most recent inventory, and then multiply it by the amount of inventory sold.

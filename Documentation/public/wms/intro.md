# Warehouse Management System

NP WMS connects your inventory management in Business Central with your POS solution and your online store, and makes every item visible across the supply chain, distribution centers, and sales channels.

It is linked with Business Central Warehousing module. NP WMS makes use of these warehouse documents created on BC and are exposed on a mobile device to facilitates warehouse movements.

NaviPartner provides two standard templates to accelerate the setup procedures:

# Artifact Feeds (Package Sources)

Artifact feeds are among the options for using, interacting and/or delivering NaviPartner apps. Usually, developers interested in development on top of [NP Retail](https://www.navipartner.com/pos-system/) use **Crane Containers** (Docker containers with core products' deployment), and thus don't need to interact with our apps through feeds. However, artifact feeds may be very useful as a source of our apps for partners who use their own development platforms. Additionally, the feeds serve a purpose in getting the correct app versions for deployment to environments.

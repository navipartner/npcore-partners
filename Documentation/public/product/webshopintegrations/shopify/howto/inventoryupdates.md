## Set up inventory update sending (Location links)

Each location in Business Central for which you want to send available inventory to Shopify, must be linked to a Shopify location. To do this:

1. Click the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../../../images/Icons/Lightbulb_icon.png "Tell Me what you want to do") button, enter **Locations** and select the related link.         
   The list of all existing locations in the system is displayed. If there aren't any locations that you can link to Shopify, [a new one needs to be created](../../../../404.md).
                  
 > [!Note]
 > You can link as many Business Central locations to a single Shopify location as you wish, but it's impossible to link multiple Shopify locations to a single location in Business Central.

3. Click the ![Ellipsis icon](../../../../images/Icons/elipsis_icon.png "Assist Edit") button next to the **Shopify Location ID** field in the **Shopify** section, and specify the necessary values.      
   If you've already set up the connection parameters on the **Shopify Integration Setup** page, you will see a list of available Shopify locations to choose from.

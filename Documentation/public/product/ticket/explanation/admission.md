# Ticket Admission

A **Ticket Admission** define what a ticket is valid for. 

The admission **Type** determine whether it represents a location or event. 
A location is typically physical, such as a museum, while an event is something within the location, such as a guided tour.
They mostly work in the same way, but there are a few exceptions. A key difference is that a ticket for an event admission is valid for a specific time only, while location admissions are open and thus valid for any time within a larger timeframe.

[!NOTE]
A ticket must include at least one ticket admission.

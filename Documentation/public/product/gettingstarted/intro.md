# Welcome to the NP Retail product documentation

Our product documentation consists of three distinct groups of articles - explanations, how-to guides, and  tutorials. Since our new documentation portal (the one you're reading right now) is still under construction, each feature will have at least one of these article types associated with them in the table of contents, although this isn't yet the case. 

- **Explanations** - contain high-level information about functionalities. Refer to them if you wish to know more about usage and capabilities of each functionality.
- **How-to guides** - provide you with a series of steps that need to be completed in order to perform a certain task. 
- **Tutorials** - provide instructions for completing certain tasks intended for beginners who don't have prior knowledge of Business Central.

> [!Note]
> Explanations of fields and options in the application have been delegated to the in-app tooltips, and will not be explained in this portal.

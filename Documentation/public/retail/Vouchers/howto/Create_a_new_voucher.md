# Create a new voucher

After the [voucher type](../explanation/Voucher_types.md) is created, the voucher needs to be sold.

1. The buttons for issuing vouchers should be created in the POS, so that the voucher can be sold. The button must have **Action â€“ ISSUE_VOUCHER** set.   
   The parameters set on this button determine which voucher will be created with which amount, and how much the customer will pay for it.

- **Amount** - when the button is used, if the amount is entered, the voucher will be created with this value.
- **ContactInfo** - If the voucher should contain contact information select True. In this way, at the time of voucher creation in the POS, a window in which contact information can be entered will be displayed.
- **DiscountAmount** - The price of the voucher will be reduced according the discount amount provided in this field.
- **DiscountType** - You can choose between a specific amount, percentage, or no specific type.
- **Quantity** - when the button is used, if quantity is entered, it will be created this number of vouchers.
- **ScanReferenceNos** - This value should be set to **false**.
- **VoucherTypeCode** - Choose which voucher type will be created when the button is used.

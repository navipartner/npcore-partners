# POS units

POS units are a central part of the retail solution. They consist of [hardware](../gettingstarted/system_requirements.md) and software components that enable services and item sale transactions at retail locations. The transactions can be recorded and sent to customers via text or email or printed in the form of a receipt. In brief, POS units automate the transaction process and tracking of important sales data. 

They are also highly customizable - it's possible to configure each of their many aspects. To find out more, refer to one of the following links.

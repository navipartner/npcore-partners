      - Item
      - Customer
      - Payment type

   - **Background Color** - the color of button in the POS unit.
   - **Caption Position** -  the position of the caption on the button (options – Top, Center, Bottom).
   - **Position X** - the number of the position in the x axis of the menu where this button will be positioned.
   - **Position Y** – the number of the position in the y axis of the menu where this button will be positioned.
   - **Enabled** - determines whether the field is enabled in the POS (options – Yes, No, Auto). If some of the necessary actions have been performed, the button will be enabled. For example, if the sales line is entered, the button **Delete Line** will be enabled.
   - **POS unit No.** - if the button needs to be seen only in one POS unit, that POS unit's number needs to be stated here.
   - **Salesperson Code** - if the button needs to be seen only by one salesperson, the salesperson's code needs to be stated here.

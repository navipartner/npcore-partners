# Manually post POS entries and check if they are posted

After a sale is finalized on the POS, an entry is automatically created in the **POS Entry List** administrative section. In the **Post Item Entry Status** and **Post Entry Status** fields, you can see whether the entry has been posted or not. 

To post an entry manually, follow the provided steps:

1. Select the entry line you wish to post. 
2. Open the **Process** dropdown in the ribbon, and click **Post Entry**.     
   The status of the entry is changed to **Posted** in the **Post Item Entry Status** and **Post Entry Status** fields.

> [!Note]
> If you wish to simultaneously post multiple entries, instead of **Post Entry**, use the **Post Range** option.

To insert initial float for filtered payment methods, go to **Edit list** and in field **Amount** insert the float in terms of different currencies that you want to fill in the POS Payment Bin for that POS Unit.

Once initial float is inserted and confirmed on OK button, there is no way for correction through the same page. If you try to correct (change) initial float you will get error message that initial float already exist. In this way posibility for fraud is avoided.

If a mistake is made, when you open the POS unit for the first time, you will have option to count and correct error. You will get confirmation screen to confirm if the physical float is the same as float inserted in **POS Payment Bin Set Float** page.

# Insert the initial float for a POS Unit

This article shows how to insert starting floats for the POS units.  
The float is the amount in the payment bin when opening the POS unit. Each payment method can have a float, though it is generally only cash that is kept in the payment bin with a float.
To insert an initial float, follow the provided steps.


### Prerequisites:

 - Have at least one existing POS unit in the system.
 - Have the POS payment methods configured.


1. Click the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../../images/Icons/Lightbulb_icon.png "Tell Me what you want to do") button, enter **POS Unit List** and choose the related link.     
   A list of all existing POS units is displayed.  
2. Click on the POS unit where you wish to insert an initial float.
3. Click on the dropdown next to the **Default POS Payment Bin** and then **Select from full list**.  
4. Click on the function **Insert Initial Float** found in the menu. This opens the page **POS Payment Bin Set Float**.
5. Click **Edit List**.
6. Find the payment methods that need a float, select the field **Amount**, and input the floats.
> [!NOTE]
> Use foreign currencies in their own denomination. Do not convert foreign currencies into the local currency value in the **Amount** field.
7. Ensure that all floats are set correctly. This action can not be reversed or re-done once the function is concluded.
8. Click OK. The float is now set for this payment bin.

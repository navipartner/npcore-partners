# Item add-ons

The ItemAddOns menu is a feature that allows you to associate a set of items in a POS to another (main) item in a menu format.

Using a restaurant's burger menu as an example, you can add different side dishes or sauces to the burger, which is the main item. Another good example of item add-on usage are electrical appliances, since you can choose from different aftersales service levels or insurance scheme offerings.

There are two different options:

- The Item AddOns Menu is associated to the specific main item.
- The Item AddOns Menu is independent, and can be used with any sale.

The following setup components need to be done before associating the add-ons to the main item: 

1. Create **Item AddOns Menu**.
2. Associate the **Item AddOns** to the main item that you want to use it with. 

You need to perform the following setup if you want to create the AddOns Menu as a standalone:

1. Create **Item AddOns**.
2. Create the [**POS Button**](../pos/howto/../../howto/Create_a_new_item_button_in_the_POS.md) for the Item AddOns menu to be used in the POS.

# Item AddOns

The ItemAddOns menu is a feature that allows you to associate a set of items in a POS to another (main) item in a menu format.

Using a restaurant's burger menu as an example, you can add different side dishes or sauces to the burger, which is the main item. Another good example of Item AddOn usage are electrical appliances, since you can choose from different aftersales service levels or insurance scheme offerings.

There are two different options:

- The Item AddOns Menu is associated to the specific main item.
- The Item AddOns Menu is independent, and can be used with any sale.

The following setup components need to be done before associating the AddOns to the main item: 

1. Create Item AddOns Menu.
2. Associate the Item AddOns to the main item that you want to use it with. 

You need to perform the following setup if you want to create the AddOns Menu as a standalone:

1. Create Item AddOns.
2. Create the POS Button for the Item AddOns menu to be used in the POS.

# Payment Gateways

Payment Gateways play an integral role in the integration with webshops, when you're performing order handling in Business Central.

NP Retail comes with a module to handle the payments done on web orders. The out-of-the-box NP Retail has integrations with the following Payment Service Providers:

- [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/our-solution/online-payments)
- [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/online/)
- Dibs
- Netaxept
- [Nets Easy](https://www.nets.eu/payments/online)
- [QuickPay](https://quickpay.net)

The module enables you to use a combination of Payment Service Providers for capturing, refunding, and cancelling transactions based on operations performed in Business Central.

> [!NOTE]
> If your Payment Service Provider is not shown on this list, your partner has an [option of developing a custom integration](https://github.com/navipartner/payment-gateway-integration-example/).

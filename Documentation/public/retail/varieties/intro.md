# Varieties in NP Retail

Variety is a tool that assists users in creating and associating different characteristics with items. The most common characteristics, or variants, of items are **Color**, **Size**, **Waist**, and **Length**. There are also other variants that are specific to certain types of merchandise, for example **Label**, **Wash**, and **Fit** in regards to clothes. 

NP Retail has a tool that can be used for defining the variants associated with various items. The stock is maintained per a combination of variants, and is sold in these particular combinations. The tool doesn't affect any calculation routines (e.g. finding sales prices/cost prices, posting routines etc.). Rather, it represents variants in a more structured way. It also allows users to apply all item variants to an item simultaneously.

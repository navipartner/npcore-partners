# Electronic Funds Transfer

Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) is a term that covers all of our electronic payment integrations in the NP Retail.
This can be anything from credit card terminals to smartphone payment systems, depending on the local market and our available integrations.

This section of documentation will dive into how to configure the EFT modules, explain some of the core concepts and also provide technical reference material for adding a custom integration from a 3rd party business central extension.

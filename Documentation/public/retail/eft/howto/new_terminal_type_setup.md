# Set up a new terminal type

Although the Pepper package already contains a short list of terminals, you may need to add your own terminal types as well. The information for the Pepper Terminal Type can be found on [Treibauf](https://www.treibauf.ch/en/terminal-type-search/).


To set up a new **Pepper Terminal Type** for a **Lane/3000** terminal, which is **Pepper Terminal Type 96**, follow the provided steps:

1. Click the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../../images/Icons/Lightbulb_icon.png "Tell Me what you want to do") button, enter **Pepper Terminal Types**, and choose the related link.    
2. Click **New** to create an entry.
3. In the **Pepper Terminal Type Card** for **ID** fill in **96**.       
    The provided information should always comply with the **Pepper Terminal Type** in the **Treibauf** page.
4. For **Description** fill in **Lane/3000 IP**.    
    The description field isn’t necessary, but it’s useful for providing clarification.
5. **Activate** the terminal type via the corresponding checkbox.
6. **Exit** the page.       
    The new **Terminal Type** is ready to be used.

# Set up button to install Pepper

Before you can use Pepper on your POS, you need to set up the button on the POS and install Pepper locally on your computer through the POS.

To set up a **Pepper** button in the **SALE-LEFT** part of the POS, follow the provided steps:

1. Click the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../../images/Icons/Lightbulb_icon.png "Tell Me what you want to do") button, enter **POS Menus**, and choose the related link.         	
2. Select **SALE-LEFT** and press **Buttons**.
3. Go to a new line and provide **Pepper install** in the **Caption**.
4. In the **Action Type** dropdown select the **Action** type.
5. In the **Action Code** click ![Elipsis icon](../../../images/Icons/elipsis_icon.png "Three dots") to open the available **POS Actions**. 
6. Search for Pepper and select the **EFT_PEPPER_INSTALL POS** action.       
    Searching for Pepper retrieves a few other actions that can be used with Pepper terminals, such as **Open** and **Close**.

    Since the **POS Action** doesnâ€™t have any further parameters, the button is now set up. You can now install Pepper locally through the POS.

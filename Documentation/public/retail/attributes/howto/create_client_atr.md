# Set up client attributes

Client attributes are extra fields that can be added to the **Item** and **Members** tables. They can be used for analysis and definition of specific properties associated with items or members. You can define these attributes in their respective **Client Attribute Cards**. 

To create client attributes, follow the provided steps:

1. Click the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../../images/Icons/Lightbulb_icon.png "Tell Me what you want to do") button, enter **Client Attributes**, and choose the related link.           
   The administrative section for defining client attributes is displayed.
2. Populate all the necessary [fields](../reference/client_attribute.md).
3. Open the **Client Attribute IDs** section by clicking **Attribute ID** in the **Related** dropdown in the ribbon to define on which tables the attribute will be attached.
4. Associate the created client attributes with the table's ID, and enable the attribute on the required page from **Client Attribute IDs**.
5. Define the associated values in **Client Attribute Value Lookup** (reached via the **Related** dropdown in the ribbon) where needed.    
   It's possible to define values if the attribute is either of the **Code** or the **Lookup** type.

# How to assign points on sale

After members and loyalty setup are created, points can be assigned to customer on sale. Main thing about assigning points on sale to members is to scan member card (choose member on POS). Scanning member card can be done by choosing button **Scan Member Card**:

![Scan_member_card](../Loyalty/images/Scan%20member%20card.png)

and entering number of card which can be found in page **Member** card:

![Scaned_member_card](../Loyalty/images/Member%20card%20scaned.png)

After card is scaned, member will be assigned to sale and member can accumulate points.

After this, sale is done as any other sale. Select items customer wants to buy and finish sale with payment. 

If we imagine that customer bought item which price is 49EUR, and in **Loyalty setup** we set that for every EUR spent customer will get 1 point, in membership card after sale is done points will be shown in tab **Membership Point entry**:

In case that instead of Loyalty setup for assigning points is used **Item point setup** and only some of items will bring points to customer, any sale of other items will not bring any points to customer.

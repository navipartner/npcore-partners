# Intro

The POS Tax Free Profile is used for setting up the tax-free integration when POS sales are performed. When established, it ensures that certain types of goods aren't taxed. 

Global Blue is a company which provides tax-free shopping services. Its IC2 solution is available on POS terminals, as well as other channels. It's possible to set up Global Blue Tax Free in NP Retail.

If a shop is tax-free, that means that all sales performed in it are exempt from the payment of certain taxes/duties.

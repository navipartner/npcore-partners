# Set up counting in Business Central and the RFID app

With the RFID technology, it is possible to perform periodic stock counting/physical inventory assessment without interrupting the overall inventory flow through the warehouse. As a prerequisite, an RFID tag or label should be placed on inventory and assets. After the necessary setup is performed, the RFID handheld can be used to automate the data collection process. 

## Benefits

- RFID has the ability to read many items simultaneously. The technology also doesn't that the tags/labels are in visual range of the handheld for the scanning to be successful.
- Inventory counts can be performed in shorter intervals, since RFID scanning isn't as time consuming as barcode and NFC scanning.
- The amount of lost/out of inventory occurrences is reduced.


## Counting, adjusting, and reclassifying inventory

NP WMS offers three main options that help facilitate and monitor warehouse inventory. 

Item journal - If you need to adjust recorded inventory quantities, in connection with counting or for other purposes, you can use this module to change the inventory ledger entries directly, without posting business transactions. Alternatively, you can adjust a single item on the **Item Card**.

Item reclassification journal - You can use it to change attributes on the item ledger entries, as well as the quantities. Typical attributes to reclassify are serial/LOT numbers, expiration dates etc. 

Physical inventory - You can use this module to check if the quantity registered is the same as the physical quantity in stock. If there are differences, they can be posted to the item accounts before the inventory evaluation is performed.

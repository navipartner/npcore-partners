# Link the assignments to the case system

To create assignments linked to the case system, follow the provided steps:

1. From the project board in DevOps Azure, click **New Item** in the **Backlog** column, and add the assignment title.    
   The assignment ID will be automatically generated, and this ID will correspond to the **DevOps Work Item Id** field in the case system. 
2. In the **Area** field, add the name of the project the assignment is a part of, and in **Iteration**, select the correct project iteration (the project area stage).
3. Add the name of the assignee that will correspond to the **Person Responsible** value in the case system. 
4. Provide the description; add all details necessary for reaching the goal of the assignment.
5. Provide the estimates if agreed on any with the client. 
6. State the **Priority** of the assignment.    
   Currently, if the priority hasn't been defined, the assignment card color will be changed to yellow, and if the priority is very high (1), the card will become red. This division makes it easy to scan the priority distribution on the board itself. 
7. Click **Save & Close**.    
   As a result, the case is generated in the case system, the DevOps assignment is tagged with its number/ID automatically.

**NOTE:** 
Providing the correct information in the assignment is crucial for the successful integration between the case system and DevOps Azure to take place. Always make sure that the information provided in the header corresponds to the information in the relevant case.

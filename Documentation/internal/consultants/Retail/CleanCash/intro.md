# CleanCash® hosted solution

Sweden has passed a Legislation on January 1st 2010 requiring anyone who sells goods and services in return for payments by card or cash to use a certified cash register/POS.
CleanCash® is Retail Innovation's fiscal control module for certified cash registers in the Swedish and Belgian markets. Hence, any POS solution needs to have their registers certified.

The range consists of CleanCash® Type A where each cash register/POS has its own controller and CleanCash® Multiuser is a control unit that can manage several funds and/or more companies.

The market leader has chosen CleanCash® Type A after extensive internal and external testing. There are over 80,000 CleanCash® units installed  our end customers' side. The POS sends information about each receipt to CleanCash®, which encrypts and stores the information in an internal database, then generates a control code that is sent back to the POS. This control code is then printed on the receipt, and stored on a fund control strip or a log memory fund. All cash linked to CleanCash® control units has the ability to print the Tax Agency's control code on each receipt. The control code demonstrates to the customer that the receipt is properly handled and that the trader has a distinguishing status.

NaviPartner has developed an interface with CleanCash® so that our clients in Sweden have their POS units comply with the regulations and legislation in place, by having the link to a certified controller.

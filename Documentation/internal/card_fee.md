# Card fee

The credit card company charges a fee for the service it provides. The business has the option to absorb the fee or charge it to the customer. If that business does absorb the fee, no setup is required on our end. The fee is treated in the basic accounting as an expense to the business when they receive the statement from the card company. 

However, if the business charges a fee in NP Retail, it's necessary to add an additional line to the sales screen of the POS for the charge. This is done in the **Payment Type** administrative section. 


- The fee can be calculated as a fixed amount of a percentage of the sale paid with the credit card, and for that reason there are two fields in the **Payment Type** section, each corresponding to one of the listed fee calculations. 

- The next configuration is for defining an item which will be used in the transaction screen on the POS to show the card fee charged on the sale. 

> [!Note] 
> From the NAV 2016 version onwards, there is a facility for defining an item as **Service** type instead of **Inventory**. We can define the type as service if we don't want to see it as an item in our stock.

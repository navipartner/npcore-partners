# Contributor guide 
The purpose of this document is to guide you through the process of delivering documentation that is suitable for our users' needs.

 ## Prerequisites

Before you start writing, it's important to ask yourself the following questions:

- **Who is the core audience?**  
  Are they more setup-oriented, or do they fall into the end-user category? How much do they know about the application? Different levels of complexity and technicality are recommended when writing for these user types. 
- **What do they wish to accomplish?**   
  Some users read documentation because they need help in achieving a certain goal, while others need to get acquainted with the product or its individual functionalities. These two groups of people require completely different types of documentation. 
- **How will the customer find the content?**  
  What search terms will the customer use? Plan for search keyword optimization when writing.

When writing technical documentation, it's also important to:

- **Write brief and meaningful text**  
  Technical documentation should cater to the users' immediate needs. Organize your content into short but meaningful sentences wherever possible.
- **Avoid unneccessary information**  
  Although it may be difficult, you need to put yourself in the users' shoes and separate information that you personally think is neat, and information that a user needs.
- **Prioritize**  
  Lead with the information that matters the most, so that readers know immediatelly where to focus their attention.
- **Not be abstract**  
  The best practice for this point is to be intimately acquainted with the subject. Once you do this, your writing will automatically become more straight-to-the-point.


## Documentation sections
There are several topic structures that you can choose from, depending on the subject, knowledge levels, and the goal of the reader. Each of these topic structures should correspond to one or more Help sections that we plan on introducing in our documentation.

### Tutorials
Tutorials are intended for users who have no prior knowledge about a subject matter. They need to contain easy-to-understand steps for achieving a certain goal, ideally accompanied with some screenshots. Examples of tutorials would be introductory topics and getting-started guides.

### How-to guides
By their nature, how-to guides are problem-oriented. Unlike tutorials, how-to guides require a higher level of knowledge as a prerequisite for understanding, and completing a task.
How-to guides should consist of a short description and a procedure divided into 15 steps at most. They can contain screenshots, but they should be replaced with textual instructions whenever possible. 

### Reference guides
Reference guides contain information organized into lists or tables, which makes them perfect for quick reference.

There are several types of reference gudes that will be used in the documentation.
- API reference guide
- Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
- Reference tables (Glossaries)

### Explanations
Explanations are understanding-oriented. They contain descriptions, explanations and illustrations which make it easier for users to understand functionalities and their purpose.

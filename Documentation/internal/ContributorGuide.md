# Contributor guide 
This document guides you through the process of standardizing and delivering documentation that complies to our users' needs.

 ## Prerequisites

Before you start writing, it's important to ask yourself the following questions:

- **Who is the target audience?**  
  Are they more setup-oriented, or do they fall into the end-user category? How much do they know about the application? Different levels of complexity and technicality are recommended depending on the target audience. 
- **What do they wish to accomplish?**   
  Some users read documentation because they need help in achieving a certain goal, while others need to get acquainted with the product or its individual functionalities. These two groups of people require completely different types of documentation. 
- **How will the customer find the content?/What search terms will the reader use?**  
  Plan for search keyword optimization when writing.
- **How many topics does the feature require?**   
  It's important to plan ahead and not to put too much information into a single topic. Typically, readers lose focus after a while, so it's important to keep them engaged.

## General documentation guidelines:

To ensure that the documentation style is unified, the following guidelines should be applied, regardless of the type of topic that you're writing:

- **Use standard English (United States (U.S.)**  
  When in doubt, refer to the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/), but the spell checker plugin should automatically take care of all language-related dilemmas for you.
- **Write in second person**  
  Address the reader directly (benefits: friendly tone, shorter sentences, avoids being gender-specific).
- **If you can, use the present tense and active voice**  
  They are easier to read and understand. They also improve searchability.
- **Use the sentence-style capitalization in headings**
- **Use consistent terminology**  
  We will create a glossary that you can refer to when you need reassurance.
- **Test the validity of information**  
  Don't write from memory no matter how familiar with the subject you are. It's absolutely necessary to perform testing in the app before or during the writing.
- **Write brief and meaningful text**  
  Technical documentation should cater to the users' immediate needs. Organize your content into short but meaningful sentences wherever possible.
- **Prioritize**  
  Lead with the information that matters the most, so that readers know immediately where to focus their attention.
- **Don't be abstract**  
  Basically, if you're intimately acquainted with the subject, your writing should automatically become more straight-to-the-point.
- **Avoid unnecessary information**  
  Put yourself in the users' shoes and separate information that you personally think is interesting, and information that users need.
  
  What is unnecessary information?
   - **Description of UI elements**  
   You shouldn't write about things that users can already clearly see in the app.
   - **Repetitive content**  
   There's no need to state the same thing more than once per a topic.

## Documentation sections and structure
There are several topic structures that you can choose from, depending on the subject, knowledge levels, and the goal of the reader.

### How-to guides (Procedures)
By its nature, a how-to guide is problem-oriented and has a clear, defined trajectory and destination. It addresses a specific question. It shows someone - who can be assumed to have some basic knowledge already - how to achieve something.
How-to guides should consist of a short description and a procedure divided into 15 steps at most. Each step can have a step result, if necessary. The how-to topics can contain screenshots, but they should be replaced with textual instructions whenever possible. 

### Guidelines for writing how-to guides (procedures)
 Follow this structure:

 **Short description**  
 The short description should contain some basic information about the topic subject. Effective short descriptions provide enough context for a reader to understand what the topic conveys. It preferably contains keywords which help the reader to identify whether the topic contains information that's relevant to them. It should consist of no longer than two sentences. 

 **Context (if necessary)**  
 Context provides a background explanation of the task. This information helps the user understand what the purpose of the task is and what they gain by completing it. This section doesn't replace the explanation topic, although it might include some conceptual information.

 **Procedure:**
 The procedure contains information specific to completing a task. It contains a series of steps that the user must follow to accomplish the task. At least two steps are required inside a single procedure. Each step should begin with a number that determines its order within the entire procedure. 

 Other than steps, the procedure should contain step results, contextual information, screenshots or important notes that relate to the step.

 - step result - provides information on the expected outcome of a step. If a user interface is documented, the outcome could describe a dialog box opening or the appearance of the progress indicator. Step results are useful to assure a user that they are on track, but shouldn't be used for every step as this quickly becomes tedious. 
 - contextual step information - used for providing additional information about the step. 


 - Focus on answering a single question or completing a single task.
 - Name the guide well. The name should tell the reader exactly what the guide does.
 - Provide a series of steps.
 - Don't explain concepts.
 - When possible, allow for some flexibility. Think of how a procedure can apply to slightly different examples from the one you describe, or understand how to adapt it to a slightly different system or configuration from the one youâ€™re assuming.
 - One step can contain only one action that a user needs to perform. For example, you can write "Click Actions.", but you can't write "Click Actions, and then navigate to the **Bill To** panel.".

### Explanations
Explanations are understanding-oriented. They contain descriptions, explanations and illustrations which make it easier for users to understand functionalities and their purpose. Explanations should consist of a short description of the feature, followed by more detailed overview and potentially screenshots. You can also add a conclusion, but make sure that it doesn't include new information.

 #### Guidelines for writing explanations

 Follow this structure:

![Explanation structure](images\explanation_structure_plan.png)

  - Provide context.
  - Provide only the information users may be interested in; don't explain too much.
  - Write sentences that provide useful information. Sentences like "The login field is used for logging in." are unnecessary.
  - Don't instruct or provide technical reference.


## Creating screenshots
It's important to have a unified procedure and tools for taking and formatting screenshots.

A good screenshot should be focused on the point you're trying to illustrate to the target audience.
It shouldn't be too big - don't distract users with unnecessary information. Screenshots should serve as a quick illustration of the preceding sentence or paragraph, they shouldn't introduce new information. For example, if I want to indicate to users where they can find the option for changing the user language in YouTube, I would use the following screenshot:  



  ![Good screenshot example](images\Screenshot_How_To_Youtube_Example.PNG)  

The screenshot clearly indicates which part of the screen is of interest and which button needs to be clicked to achieve the desired outcome.

It also helps to frame the button that users need to find.


I recommend the [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/downloads/) screenshot-capturing tool, since it's easy to use and has many useful options.


> **_NOTE:_**  Avoid adding multiple screenshots one after the other. Wherever possible, try to add some text between them.

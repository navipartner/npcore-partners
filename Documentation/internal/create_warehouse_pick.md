# Create a warehouse pick

The warehouse pick is the process of selecting a specific quantity of items, and preparing those items for shipment. The difference between warehouse and inventory picks is in the level of warehousing functionality. Inventory picks are more simple and straightforward, while warehouse picks require an entirely new layer of processing requirements. 

In advanced warehouse configurations 

You can perform picks with or without source documents. If you're performing picks with source documents, those are usually Sales Orders. However, in scenarios where items are taken out of the warehouse pick bins temporarily, they will still be considered a part of the inventory (although they can't be picked).

When these items are returned to warehouses, they are first stored in bins. 

Rather than posting the picking information, you register the pick. This registration doesn't post consumption, it just makes the items available for posting.

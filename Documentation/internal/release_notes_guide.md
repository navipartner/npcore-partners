# Release notes guide - IN PROGRESS

Release notes are intended to provide customers with brief and concise information about:

- new features/functionalities
- updates to the existing features

> [!Note]
> The plan is to include bug fixes and removed/deprecated features at some point, but this is out of scope for now.

## How to write Release notes

- **Each update to our solutions should be described briefly, in one or two sentences.** All additional details should be relegated to the help portal and in-app tooltips (in case of new field descriptions).
- **

Use [this example](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for reference when announcing introduction of new features to the solutions.

These notes will be written in the internal markdown file, the content of which will be moved to the public file on a fixed date towards the end of each month. 

End users will in this way have direct access to all notable updates and additions to our solutions. 

Some additional information to keep in mind is:

- Release notes should be written in a customer-friendly way.
- There should be an entry for every single version. 
- The same type of changes should be grouped. 
- The latest version comes first - it's on top.

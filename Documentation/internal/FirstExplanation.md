# POS (Point of Sale) units

POS units are a central part of the POS sales solution. They consist of hardware and software elements that enable services and item sale transactions at retail locations. The transactions can be recorded and a receipt can be printed out or sent to the buyer via email or text. 

In brief, the POS units help streamline retail operations by automating the transaction process and tracking important sales data. 

As POS units in the NP Retail solution are highly customizable, it's possible to configure various aspects of them. To find out more, refer to one of the following links.

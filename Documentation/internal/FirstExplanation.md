# POS (Point of Sale) units

POS units are a central part of the POS sales solution. They consist of hardware and software elements that enable services and item sale transactions at retail locations. The transactions can be recorded and a receipt can be printed out or sent to the buyer via email or text.   

The reasons why POS units can make business operations easier are multifaceted:
 - **faster and more efficient operations**   
   regardless of its size, each business has many operation categories (purchasing materials, dispatching items, processing payments, managing bookings and appointments, and so on); it's difficult to keep track of all those operations without some form of categorization and automation.
 - **efficient inventory and employee management**   
   they are capable of tracking the real-time status of inventory, setting reordering triggers, and even providing recommendations for future purchases based on the customers' purchasing history.
 - **exhaustive business reporting**  
   can be used for recording transactions on paper or spreadsheets; gives access to the full picture, to help strategize marketing efforts and boost sales.


In brief, the POS units help streamline retail operations by automating the transaction process and tracking important sales data.

Inventory movements refer to all physical movements of the stock either to another location, or another bin, that is reflected in the accompanying documents. There are several administrative sections from which inventory movements can be performed.

- **Transfer orders** - used when stock is transferred from one location/bin to another. This process is performed in two steps (using intransit locations)

- **Item reclassification journals** - these journals are also used to perform stock transfer between locations/bins. This process is performed in one step.

- **Physical inventory journals** - used for stock counting.


NP WMS connects a company's inventory database in Business Central to the warehouse stock and makes every item visible across the supply chain, distribution centers, and sales channels. It also employs the RFID technology to more easily track item placement, status, quantity, and so on.
